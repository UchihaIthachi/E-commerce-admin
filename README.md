🛒 **E-Commerce for** 🛍️  
🏢 **System Architecture** (Current) 🛠️

---

The **E-Commerce** is a dynamic web application that facilitates both product purchasing and selling. Built using **Next.js** and integrated with cloud services such as **Sanity** (for content management), **Supabase** (for database management), and **Cloudflare** (for CDN), it ensures a responsive, secure, and scalable experience for users. The architecture is designed to handle various components, from front-end interactions to back-end data processing.

### 🔧 **System Design** 🔧

The system architecture is composed of core components: front-end, back-end, identity management, and database, all interacting seamlessly to support user transactions and data handling. The integration of **Next.js** for both server-side rendering and static site generation provides the flexibility and speed required for a modern web platform.

#### **Core Components**

1. **Admin System** (Next.js)
2. **Customer System** (Next.js, ShadCN)
3. **Content Management** (Sanity)
4. **Database** (Supabase, PostgreSQL)
5. **Identity Service** (Clerk Auth for admin)
6. **CDN** (Cloudflare)

---

- **Admin System:**  
  The admin panel is used to manage products, categories, subcategories, inventory, orders, and customers. It is built using **Next.js** and **Sanity CMS** (headless) for managing dynamic content such as categories, banners, and product details.
- **Customer System:**  
  The customer-facing part of the platform, still under development, will be built using **Next.js 13** with AppRouter for smooth routing and navigation. Users can browse products, add items to the cart, manage their profiles, and checkout with ease.

---

#### **Content Management [Headless CMS (Sanity)]**

The integration of **Sanity** ensures that product information, user-generated content, and any dynamic data can be updated and managed easily through a content management interface. The platform can pull content from **Sanity** to dynamically update the product listings, blogs, or promotional materials.

- **Dynamic Client (No CDN use):**  
  Manages dynamic data like **category**, **subcategory**, **banner**, **color**, **grid-item**, and **size**. This data is retrieved from Sanity without utilizing the CDN.

- **Static Client (Uses CDN):**  
  Manages static content such as **cloth** product images, which benefit from the caching and fast delivery through **Sanity's CDN**.

---

- **Backend (Database, Authentication, Session Management):**  
  Data is managed using **Prisma ORM** and **PostgreSQL** (via **Supabase**). It handles models like **Delivery**, **Pickup**, **Order**, **Account**, **Session**, **VerificationToken**, **User**, **Address**, **Cart**, and **Cart-item**. Supabase provides a secure and scalable environment for managing relational data.

---

#### **Identity Service**

- **Clerk Auth** will manage user authentication and authorization for the admin side of the platform. It will secure access to the platform's internal management tools, ensuring only authorized users can update products, manage orders, or perform administrative tasks.

---

#### **CDN**

- **Cloudflare** is used for content delivery, ensuring that static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files load quickly, even in regions far from the server’s origin.

- **Sanity CDN**  
  **Sanity's CDN** is used for optimizing the delivery of static content such as **cloth** images. It caches and serves content from multiple edge locations to ensure fast loading times and improve overall user experience.

---

### **Architecture Patterns**

The project employs several key architecture patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficiency:

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):**  
  The application uses **CQRS** to separate the command (write) and query (read) operations, enabling better scalability and performance. This pattern helps to optimize the system for high-load environments by handling reads and writes separately.

- **DTO (Data Transfer Object):**  
  Data is transferred between components using **DTOs**, which are lightweight objects containing only the necessary data for communication between components. This pattern minimizes the data transferred, improving performance and reducing overhead.

- **Repository Pattern:**  
  The back-end services are designed using the **Repository pattern**, which abstracts the data access logic from the business logic. This separation allows for easier unit testing, better maintainability, and more flexibility when changing the data storage or retrieval methods.

- **Layered Architecture:**  
  The system follows a **Layered Architecture** pattern, separating the application into distinct layers for better manageability and scalability:

  - **Frontend Layer:**  
    This layer is responsible for the user interface and interaction. Built using **Next.js** and integrated with **ShadCN**, it handles user input, rendering, and communicating with the back-end.
  - **Business Logic Layer:**  
    The **Business Logic Layer** handles the core functionality and operations of the platform. It includes services that process orders, manage inventory, and handle authentication and session management. This layer uses the **Repository pattern** for data access and ensures the integrity of business rules.
  - **Data Access Layer:**  
    The **Data Access Layer** abstracts interactions with the database, utilizing **Prisma ORM** for seamless communication with the **PostgreSQL** database via **Supabase**. This layer is responsible for querying, inserting, and managing data records like **Delivery**, **Pickup**, **Orders**, **Cart**, and **User**.
  - **Database Layer:**  
    The **Database Layer** contains the actual data storage, in this case, using **PostgreSQL** (via **Supabase**). It manages persistent storage for user data, orders, sessions, and more.

- **Headless CMS Pattern:**  
  The system integrates **Sanity CMS** as a **Headless CMS**, enabling content management and delivery as structured data through APIs. This pattern decouples content management from the presentation layer, offering flexibility and scalability.
